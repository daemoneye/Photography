# Photography Script

This tool generates the static page for photos.daemo.nz

## Flags
### --verbose, -v
Prints data on what the script is doing

### --version
Prints version number of script. The index.html page also states the version in the footer.

## Versioning
The version set in code gets updated when:
- Minor changes cause a minor version update.
- When the minor version hits 30, it gets reset to 0 and the major version gets incremented.
- Major changes, such as a logical change, cause the major version to increment.

# styles.css
For now, we just need some formatting for the images. Any format changes will be added here.
